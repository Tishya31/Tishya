# Develop a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and content-based methods to suggest products to customers based on their past behavior and preferences. Use Case: E-commerce giants like Amazon and Netflix use ML to deliver personalized recommendations, increasing user engagement and sales. Students can work on building a recommendation system using datasets like MovieLens or Amazon Reviews to offer personalized shopping experiences.

# The ratings dataset contains user-generated movie ratings. Each row represents a single rating for a movie, with information about the user who made the rating, the movie they rated, and the rating itself. This dataset is essential for collaborative filtering, as it allows us to predict the rating a user might give to unseen movies.

# The movies dataset contains information about movies, including the title and the genres they belong to. This dataset is crucial for content-based filtering, where recommendations are made based on the content features of the movies (e.g., genres, keywords).
